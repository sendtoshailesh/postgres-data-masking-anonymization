# Best Practices for PostgreSQL Anonymizer

This document outlines best practices for using PostgreSQL Anonymizer effectively and securely.

## Planning Your Anonymization Strategy

1. **Identify Sensitive Data**
   - Conduct a data audit to identify all PII and sensitive data
   - Classify data by sensitivity level (high, medium, low)
   - Document regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.)

2. **Choose Appropriate Anonymization Techniques**
   - Use masking for data that needs to maintain format
   - Use pseudonymization when relationships need to be preserved
   - Use generalization for statistical analysis
   - Use randomization when exact values aren't important

3. **Balance Utility and Privacy**
   - Consider the intended use of the anonymized data
   - Ensure anonymized data remains useful for its purpose
   - Test anonymization with actual use cases

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Use Declarative Approach**
   ```sql
   -- Define masking rules in the database schema
   SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN customers.email IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.partial_email(email)';
   ```

2. **Create Different Masking Levels**
   ```sql
   -- Create different views for different access levels
   CREATE VIEW highly_masked_data AS SELECT id, anon.fake_name() AS name FROM customers;
   CREATE VIEW partially_masked_data AS SELECT id, anon.partial(name, 1, '***', 0) AS name FROM customers;
   ```

3. **Use Materialized Views for Performance**
   ```sql
   -- Create materialized views for better performance
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW masked_employees_mat AS SELECT * FROM masked_employees;
   
   -- Schedule regular refreshes
   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW masked_employees_mat;
   ```

4. **Implement Role-Based Access Control**
   ```sql
   -- Create roles with different access levels
   CREATE ROLE analyst WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
   CREATE ROLE developer WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
   
   -- Grant appropriate access
   GRANT SELECT ON masked_employees_mat TO analyst;
   SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON ROLE developer IS 'MASKED';
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Protect Anonymization Rules**
   - Limit access to security labels and masking rules
   - Audit changes to anonymization configurations
   - Store masking rules in version control

2. **Secure Connection Strings**
   - Don't include passwords in connection strings
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Use connection pooling with secure authentication

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Periodically review anonymization effectiveness
   - Test for potential re-identification risks
   - Update anonymization techniques as needed

4. **Backup Management**
   - Ensure backups are also anonymized if they contain sensitive data
   - Implement separate backup policies for anonymized and raw data
   - Test restoration of anonymized backups

## Performance Optimization

1. **Index Considerations**
   ```sql
   -- Create indexes on frequently queried columns in materialized views
   CREATE INDEX ON masked_employees_mat (last_name);
   ```

2. **Batch Processing for Large Datasets**
   ```sql
   -- Process large tables in batches
   DO $$
   DECLARE
       batch_size INT := 10000;
       max_id INT;
       current_id INT := 0;
   BEGIN
       SELECT MAX(id) INTO max_id FROM large_table;
       WHILE current_id <= max_id LOOP
           -- Process batch
           UPDATE large_table 
           SET email = anon.partial_email(email)
           WHERE id > current_id AND id <= current_id + batch_size;
           
           current_id := current_id + batch_size;
           COMMIT;
       END LOOP;
   END $$;
   ```

3. **Function Performance**
   - Use simpler masking functions for large datasets
   - Consider pre-computing complex anonymizations
   - Test performance with representative data volumes

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Track Anonymization Coverage**
   ```sql
   -- Query to check which columns have masking rules
   SELECT 
       relname AS table_name, 
       attname AS column_name, 
       label AS masking_rule
   FROM pg_seclabel
   JOIN pg_class ON pg_seclabel.objoid = pg_class.oid
   JOIN pg_attribute ON pg_class.oid = pg_attribute.attrelid 
                     AND pg_seclabel.objsubid = pg_attribute.attnum
   WHERE provider = 'anon';
   ```

2. **Validate Anonymization Effectiveness**
   - Regularly test if anonymized data can be re-identified
   - Use k-anonymity, l-diversity, or t-closeness metrics
   - Consider external expert reviews of anonymization approach

3. **Update Anonymization as Data Changes**
   - Review anonymization when new data types are added
   - Update masking rules when data formats change
   - Adjust anonymization for new regulatory requirements
